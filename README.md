# WoW Voiceover: TBC \& WoTLK

This is an unofficial expansion of [WoWVoiceOver](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover). it includes:

* Extra quests and gossip from Vanilla (item, gameobjects, and NPCs with custom models).
* Voiceover files for The Burning Crusade 
* Voiceover files for Wrath of the Lich King

Based on the original Vanilla Voiceover, using [XTTS](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2) and [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) for audio generation.

This repo currently has the code used to generate the VO files. for the actual Addon files, please refer to the project page on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/voiceover-tbc-wotlk). Please raise an issue if you have any comments or questions. Thanks!
