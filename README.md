# WoW Voiceover: TBC & WoTLK

This is an unofficial expansion of [WoWVoiceOver](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover). it includes:

- Extra quests and gossip from Vanilla (item, gameobjects, and NPCs with custom models).
- Voiceover files for The Burning Crusade (forthcoming)
- Voiceover files for Wrath of the Lich King (forthcoming)

Based on the original Vanilla Voiceover, using [XTTS](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2) and [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) for audio generation.   

##To use

Copy the AI_VoiceOver folder and any of the data folders into the addons folder. The modified addon files should recognize the original Vanilla VO files, plus any of the data modules that are copied into the addons folder.
